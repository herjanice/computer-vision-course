# Computer Vision Course Repository 2022 Spring

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of computer vision (CV), covering both classical and deep learning-based methods for recognizing and understanding the geometry of objects. Through a series of lectures, readings, and hands-on assignments, students will gain a solid foundation in the fundamental principles and techniques used in CV, as well as practical experience with state-of-the-art tools and frameworks.

Topics covered include:

1. Introduction to human vision systems
2. Camera basics, image formation, and basic image processing
3. Feature detection and matching
4. Machine learning basics
5. Deep learning basics
6. Recognition
7. Segmentation
8. Projective geometry
9. Estimation of transformations
10. Single camera geometry/camera calibration
11. Two-view geometry
12. Dense motion estimation/stereo
13. Optical flow and object tracking
14. 3D reconstruction/depth sensing
15. Structure from motion
